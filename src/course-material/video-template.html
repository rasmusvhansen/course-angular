          NYPD cop John McClanes plan to reconcile with his estranged wife is
          thrown for a serious loop when, minutes after he arrives at her
          office, the entire building is overtaken by a group of terrorists.
          With little help from the LAPD, wisecracking McClane sets out to
          single-handedly rescue the hostages and bring the bad guys down.
